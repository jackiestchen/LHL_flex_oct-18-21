Hello Labbers, 

Thanks for coming to my lecture on CRUD with express. You will find all the info on the slides attached here.

We covered all CRUD operations except the UPDATE part due to running out of time, I have added that in the final code though. 

Also some students had followup questions so we kind of implemented a small login functionality using cookies, so you might find code related to it in the repo as well.

As always, please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions to the material covered here.

Some notes on debugging: 

1. Use network tab in your console to monitor the requests that you send out
2. Make sure you start your routes with '/' while defining them (thanks Johannes for catching this)
3. Order of your route definitions matter so make sure you are defining your routes in correct manner. 
4. The convention is from Specific to Least Specific (thanks Johannes again)

As always, being an awesome dev is a lifelong learning journey, strive on! ðŸš€
